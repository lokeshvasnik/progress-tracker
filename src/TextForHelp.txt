Formula for progress percentage %

🔍 1. Progress Over Time: 40%
✅ What it means:
You’re probably tracking a 30-day challenge, and want to show how much of it is completed.

progressPercent = (numberOfDaysWithProgress / 30) * 100
🧠 Example:


const totalChallengeDays = 30;
const currentProgressDays = data.length;

const progressPercent = Math.round((currentProgressDays / totalChallengeDays) * 100);

progressPercent = Math.round((17 / 30) * 100) = 57%
